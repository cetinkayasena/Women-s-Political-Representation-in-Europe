# Women’s Political Representation in Europe (2010–2020)

This project analyzes the representation of women in politics across five European countries — including Turkey — between the years 2010 and 2020.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this study is to examine how women's political representation has evolved over time and to build predictive models that can help in understanding the underlying patterns and trends.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Cleaned the dataset using **Pandas**
- Handled missing values by filling with **feature means**
- Converted categorical variables using `pd.get_dummies()`
- Scaled numerical features with **MinMaxScaler**

## 📈 Data Visualization

Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** libraries to visualize trends and correlations:
- **Line charts** to track changes over time
- **Heatmaps** to show correlations between variables
- **Bar charts** to compare across countries

## 🤖 Machine Learning

Applied supervised learning models using **Scikit-learn**:
- **Decision Tree**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Multiple Linear Regression**

### Model Evaluation

- **Train-test split**: 80% training, 20% testing
- **Evaluation metrics**:
  - Mean Absolute Error (**MAE**)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (**RMSE**)
  - **R² Score**

> 📌 **Best performing model**: Multiple Linear Regression with **83% R² Score** and low error rates.
